# Continuous Delivery

“Deployment is manual”

“Functional tests are manual”

“Time consuming or lack of rollback on performance degradation or production errors”

“Hard to maintain environment configurations and hard to operate”

“No consistency in deployment process”

“Manual / hard coded configurations”

“No standardized software artifact”

“No release management in place”

“Too dependent on other teams to get any release done”

If these are the typical problems you face, Continuous Delivery is for you.

Continuous Delivery is the next logical step after continuous integration and it streamlines and automates the application release process to make software delivery repeatable and on demand - from provisioning the infrastructure environment to deploying the tested application software to test/staging or production environments. Organizations practicing continuous delivery are able to plan their release processes and schedules, automate infrastructure and application deployments, manage deployed infrastructure and application resources resources, and analyze metrics to optimise the software delivery process.

## Why Continuous Delivery?

**Consistent & repeatable release process** - lesser manual processes imply the release process is less error prone and hence can be repeatable for every minimal change to the code

**Faster time to market** - automation of environment provisioning, software deployment and rapid feedback helps teams to iterate faster and rollback when necessary

**Lower risk releases** - by using progressive delivery practices such as advanced deployments: incremental / blue green / canary deployments, review apps, feature flags and a deployment performance feedback loop, organizations are able to validate their software before widespread deployment
