As organizations accelerate delivery, through DevOps, controlling and managing different versions of the application assets from code to configuration and from design to deployment is incredibly important. Velocity without robust version control and traceability is like driving a car with out a seatbelt.

Version Control and Collaboration is more than simply tracking changes, versions, and branches of code. Effectively, it includes practices such as:

- Enabling development teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments
- Managing changes and versions of code and artifacts
- Enabling Review and Collaboration of code and other assets
- Tracking approvals of proposed changes
- Resolving merge conflicts and related anomalies

In general, [Version Control](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/version-control/) and Collaboration is required because software is constantly changing. Regardless of the stage of development, there will be change to deal with.
