# Agile Planning and Management


By empowering teams, embracing change, and focusing on delivering value, Agile methodologies have transformed software development. Agile teams create more relevant, valuable, customer-centric products, more quickly than ever.

Development teams accelerate the delivery of value with iterative, incremental, and lean project methodologies including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and more. Large enterprises have adopted Agile at enterprise scale through a variety of frameworks, including Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Spotify, Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), and others. GitLab enables teams to apply Agile practices and principles to organize and manage their work, whatever their chosen methodology. These new methodologies bring new challenges.

Agile is not a single methodology, but a set of guiding principles embraced by many methodologies in many ways. There is no single “best” way to plan and manage an Agile enterprise, and older project planning tools are often insufficiently flexible to address the needs of a given implementation.

This functionality gap leads to poor project estimation, planning, and progress tracking. Furthermore, Agile methodologies can create confusion between teams and throughout the enterprise, where even well-documented Agile processes may not map to traditional success metrics and waterfall financial planning.

Oragnizations need better ways to manage projects, programs, and portfolios using Agile. They need to better:

- **plan** and prioritize work based on strategic objectives
- **initiate** work
- **monitor** the progress of that work in progress
- **collaborate** on work, across teams, throughout the product lifecycle
- **control** and optimize the flow of work
- **close** work items when completed
- **measure** the value created by that work
- **communicate** that value throughout the organization, regardless of other methodologies in place
