# DevOps Modernization Workshop

### Welcome

In this workshop you will learn about the GitLab DevOps platform and how to build, test, and deploy features and functionality at a faster pace.

### Learning Objectives
- Stand up a [self managed instance of GitLab](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07SJ817DX).
- Create a project, import a sample source code.
- Configure CI/CD pipeline.
- Change the code, run the pipeline which will build, test and deploy the new code to production.

<p style='text-align: left;'>
The GitLab environment we will build is a non production grade setup. For the sake of simplicity of this workshop, we use one machine for the entire setup, we donâ€™t use clusters and Load Balancer, we install GitLab server and the Runner on the same machine.
